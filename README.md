## 🧪 Examples

### Basic subdomain discovery
```
subfinder -d example.com
```

### Save results to a file
```
subfinder -d example.com -o subdomains.txt
```

### Increase the number of threads to 50
```
subfinder -d example.com -t 50
```

### Use a custom wordlist
```
subfinder -d example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

### Enable recursive enumeration
```
subfinder -d example.com -r
```

### Resolve subdomains to IP addresses
```
